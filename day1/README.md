## Problem Description

The purpose of part 1 is to take a list of strings with alphanumeric characters and combine the first and last digit of each string then sum the resulting numbers all together. 

Ie) a1d2\nblue23test45yellow would sum to 12 + 25 = 37

Part 2 expands the above by including strings between one to nine. 

Ie) 1twothree would result in 13
